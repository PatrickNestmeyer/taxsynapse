This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.
Terrible phone holder.
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.
I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.
But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.
How stupid is that?
I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.
Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.
Good show, Samsung.
So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.
It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.
Couldn't figure it out
My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.
So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.
While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.
Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.
Works for me.
Saggy, floppy piece of junk.
much better than the hard plastic cases.
It also had a new problem.
Happy so far!.
cool phone.
Works good.
Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.
It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.
but it is great, i would really recommend it
Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.
As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!
Never got it!!!!!
This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.
[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!
Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.
You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off."
However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls.
I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.
The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.
Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.
I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.
A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.
I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.
The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.
I'm returning them.
I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.
It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.
I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.
Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.
nice leather.
I had to purchase a different case.
It is a joy to use.
Very much disappointed with this company.
Very satisifed with that.
It didn't charge for me.
This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!
Buttons are too small.
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.
Love it.. Great armband.
I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.
However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.
I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.
Also makes it easier to hold on to.
I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!
It's pretty easy.
I cannot make calls at certain places.
however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.
Beautiful styling though.
This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.
I'm trying to return it for a refund.
I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.
Excellent product.
Earbud piece breaks easily.
Lousy product.
This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.
It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.
SWEETEST PHONE!!!
:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.
It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.
Not enough volume.
Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.
don't waste your money.
I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.
Adapter does not provide enough charging current.
There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.
You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.
Phone falls out easily.
It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk.
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.
Painful on the ear.
Lasted one day and then blew up.
disappointed.
Kind of flops around.
The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.
What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.
Item Does Not Match Picture.
The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).
You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!
